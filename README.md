This is a weather Website i created while learning javascript.

Users can type in the name of the city that they wish to see the weather of.

in this project, i used the Openweather API to fetch the weather details of cities and assigned the details to different HTML components.

i learned about DOM and a lot of new javascript functions while creating this project.
